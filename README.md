# Hangman
  Hangman game AiCore project

# Game Logic
  CLI (command line interface) hangman does not have a graphical interface.
  The game has a list of words, one is chosen at random for the game and the player has to guess it.
  The game takes the user input, and the user/player starts with 5 lives.
  So there's 5 attempts can be wrong.
  After 5 incorrect attempts, or guesses, the game stops because the user/player has run out of lives.
  If the guess is correct, the game continues.
  The game then loops through the word untill the entire word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.
