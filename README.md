# Game Logic
  OOP hangman has a list of words, one is chosen at random for the game and the player has to guess it.
  The game takes the user input, with 5 lives the user has 5 attempts that can be wrong.
  The game then loops through the word untill the entire word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.
